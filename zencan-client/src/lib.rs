//! A client for communicating with zencan nodes
//!
//! The crate provides utilities for communicating with nodes, including:
//!
//! - An [SDO client](SdoClient) for reading/writing a node's object dictionary via it's SDO server
//! - An [LSS master](LssMaster) for discovering and configuring un-configured nodes with IDs
//! - A [BusManager] which is intended to be the engine behind an application, such as `zencan-cli`,
//!   keeping track of nodes, and providing an API for managing them.
//! - Defining a [NodeConfig](crate::common::node_configuration::NodeConfig) TOML file format, which allows for storing and loading node configuration (primarily
//!   PDOs, but any objects can be written)
//!
//! This library is currently based on tokio/async. The plan is to also include blocking APIs in the
//! future.
//!
//! This should be considered very alpha, with important missing features, and potentially frequent
//! breaking API changes.
